# Visual-Path-Finder
A visualized path finder algorithm. This is not completely my own.  

This was a small project i made in my free time.
Its just visualizing the A* path finding algorithm using pygame.
Many people have done this idea before and I do not take credit.

The controls are Left click for Placing. The first 2 squares placed are the start and end point. The rest are barriers/walls
Right click for erasing.
Space for starting.
C for clearing everything.
